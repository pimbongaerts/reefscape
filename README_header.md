# Photogrammetry script library
Collection of Python scripts for parsing/analysis of pointcloud data. While many of the scripts are functional, some still need considerable cleaning up and more thorough testing - and this repository therefore very much represents a *work in progress*.

These scripts all require [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), with many using either the [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) library or the [Metashape API](https://www.agisoft.com/forum/index.php?board=17.0). Other packages that may be required are: psutil and fpdf.

This documentation is dynamically generated using the listed [README_compile.py](README_compile.py) script, extracting purpose, usage and links to example files from the [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) information of each script.
